    "- hypothesis testing: alternative hypothesis: actual explanation. null hypothesis: the explanation is not sufficient. If we find that there is a difference between groups, then we can reject the null hypothesis and we accept our alternative. \n",
    "- When doing hypothesis testing, we have to choose a significance level as a threshold for how much of a chance we're willing to accept. This significance level is typically called alpha, which is normally selected as 5%.\n",
    "- significance means the evidence we observed from the data against the null hypothesis, the p value is a measure of the significance, and alpha level is a measure of our tolerance of the significance. \n",
    "- The p value reports the probability we can get the observed data under the null hypothesis, so with a larger p value (by larger we mean it is closer to 1, instead of saying that it is more extreme), we have less evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- With a larger alpha, we reject the null hypothesis less carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we're going to review some of the basics of statistical testing in python. We're going to talk about hypothesis testing, statistical significance, and using scipy to run student's t-tests."

    "In this lecture, we've discussed just some of the basics of hypothesis testing in Python. I introduced you to the SciPy library, which you can use for the students t test. We've discussed some of the practical issues which arise from looking for statistical significance. There's much more to learn about hypothesis testing, for instance, there are different tests used, depending on the shape of your data and different ways to report results instead of just p-values such as confidence intervals or bayesian analyses. But this should give you a basic idea of where to start when comparing two populations for differences, which is a common task for data scientists."
